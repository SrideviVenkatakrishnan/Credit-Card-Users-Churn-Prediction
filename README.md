# Thera Bank - Project

## Problem Definition

Credit cards are a steady source of income for banks because of the various fees charged for the services provided. The Thera Bank recently experienced a significant decline in the number of users for their credit cards. The bank wishes to figure out which of its customers are most likely to renounce their credit cards and their reason to do so.

## Objective

- To explore and visualize the data
- To build a classification model to predict if a customer will churn or not
- Optimize the model using appropriate techniques
- To generate a set of insights and recommendations that will help the bank improve its service so that the customers do not renounce their credit cards
